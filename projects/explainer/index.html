		Growing up as a springboard and platform diver in Long Beach, California, I was inexorably drawn to the thrill, experiences and mental and physical trials the sport afforded. I carried this passion for the sport through to the collegiate level competing at Stanford, molding the human I have become through a careful balance of risk and reward. I wanted to share a small glimpse into these experiences I had as a diver, hopefully inspiring others to take a leap.

		I climb the stairs of the 10 meter platform during a competition after seemingly infinite hours of stretching, ‘dry land’ exercises and mental visualizations in preparation for this one chance to perfectly execute the dive. Everything builds up to this point.

		Looking down, the water below me looks impossibly far away. As I approach the end of the platform, my mind begins to race in an attempt to remember all the hours of reassuring practice while fighting off fears of injury or failure. Shuffling my feet to find a comfortable position that doesn’t really exist calms my nerves and provides an action to focus on. At last, I finally find zen.

		I then begin my approach to the end of the platform to execute my dive. In direct contradiction of every human instinct that I hold, I leap from the platform. I have to believe in myself and in the process, but really, though, I’m jumping into the unknown.

		That first lift-off into the moment of flight is just magical. As soon as my toes leave that platform and I’m suspended in the air, that feeling of freefall, but having the control to do my rotations and twists, is really like I’m mastering gravity for three seconds.

			It’s just me, my body, my mind and the water rapidly approaching at 35 miles per hour. The platform rushing past my eye line, providing the visual clues I need to perfectly time this acrobatic fall. I prepare myself for the moment my body will tear through the water, and the crushing impact that even a perfectly executed entry brings.

		As a former diver, I hold a relentless appetite to find thrill in life. Diving taught me the reward of conquering your fears, taking risks and persevering through adversity. I am thankful to a sport that took me to inexplicable heights and continues to show me how to find adventure in everything I do.
