		A diver climbs the platform during a competition after countless hours of stretching, ‘dry land’ exercises and mental visualizations in preparation for this one chance to perfectly execute the dive. Everything builds up to this point.

		Looking down, the water below you looks impossibly far away. As the diver approaches the end of the platform, their mind begins to race in an attempt to remember all the hours of reassuring practice while fighting off fears of injury or failure. Shuffling your feet to find a comfortable position that doesn’t really exist calms your nerves, provides an action to focus on. At last, the diver finds zen.

		The diver only then begins the approach to the end of the platform to jump off. In direct contradiction of every human instinct that you hold, you will leap from the platform. You have to believe in yourself and in the process, but really, though, you’re jumping into the unknown.

		That first lift-off into the moment of flight is just magical. As soon as your toes leave that platform and you are suspended in the air, that feeling of freefall, but having the control to do your rotations, is really like you’re mastering gravity.

			It’s just you; your body, your mind and the water rapidly approaching. The platform rushing past your eye line, providing the visual clues you need to perfectly time this gymnastic falling. You prepare yourself for the moment your body will tear through the water, and the crushing impact that even a perfectly executed entry brings.
